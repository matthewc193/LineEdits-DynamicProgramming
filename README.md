# LineEdits-DynamicProgramming
Completed solutions for a dynamic programming assignment. All solutions use a bottom up approach.

# Longest Common Subsequence 
Uses a DP table to compute the LCS of any given string.

# Line Edits
Using a similar approach to LCS it finds the minimum edit distance between lines. It returns the optimal solution and uses backtracing to find which lines must be inserted, deleted, substituted or copied.

# Line Edits With Modified Characters
An extension of line edits however it specifies the exact modified character on each line rather than simply the line as a whole.
